**What's changed?**
Apart from the glaringly obvious addition of a background, the trees, the shiffman and a pink donut, you can now pause the game by pressing 'p'. Also, the gap is now sufficient to let the shiffman pass every time and can appear anywhere as opposed to always including the center.

I intend to allow users to upload their own images on Imgur etc and use them in the next commit.

I do not own the copyright of any of the images used nor do I know if anybody does. If you do, let me know.
